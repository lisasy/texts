- added the CLOSE button to the 'inventory.php' for the first two book assets; for time's sake and because it is dynamic, you can take this and add it to all (including in 'wishlist.php')

- a change you can make that Peter and I were talking about: in the navigation sidebar for profile page, it might be better to change wording from "My Inventory" to "Books I Have", and "My Wishlist" to "Books I Want"

- added a new file that shows the inbox of TRANSACTIONS happening (different from ACTIVITY page); the new file is called 'inbox.php'

- added new file: 'campus-marketplace.php'

- added new file: 'profile-sidebar.php' for the sidebar in profile page.

- added new page INBOX to 'profile-sidebar.php'

- 'market-widget.php'

- deleted 'landing.php' because I already have 'index.php'

- added a div class called "empty-box" which appears on Activity/Books I Have/Books I Want when there is no content.
